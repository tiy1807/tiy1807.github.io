Visit my [github pages site](https://tiy1807.github.io/index) for HTML templates.

## Generate HTML from markdown(ish)

Run generate_html.py (in docs/assets/scripts) to convert all the markdown files in docs/assets/markdown to create html versions in the root directory.

Not all markdown is supported, and there are extensions, see test-project.md for examples.
